## Statement of Purpose and Scope

### What the app does
Covidinfo aims to educate Australian citizens about the global pandemic known as Covid-19 aka Corona virus. The application works in a mini-course style format. At first, it educates the users about the virus. It has a wide range of information which includes the number of confirmed cases in Australia and what the common symptoms of the virus are. It then provides information on who to contact when concerned if one is suffering from the virus. 
Covidinfo then educates users on how to stay safe from the virus, by providing tips and advice, which both, prevent the contraction of the virus, and minimizes the spread of it. 
After educating users about the virus and ways to overcome it, Covidinfo then provides a quiz which ensures information retention amongst the users.

### Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
With the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring Covid-19 as a pandemic, it is important for people to stay educated. One of the main problems about this virus is that many people don’t understand the extent of this virus, and even if they do, don’t know how to keep themselves safe from it.

Covidinfo fixes this issue by educating users about the virus in general, then giving them advice on how to reduce the possibility of spreading.

### Explain how a member of the target audience will use it
Covidinfo is set up in a way where users can easily access the app. All a user would have to do is install the terminal app. Covidinfo asks the user if they have heard about the Covid-19. Regardless of answer, the app takes the user to the welcome screen and the menu. The user will read general information on the Corona Virus followed by information on how to reduce the possibility of spreading then virus. The user will then be prompted to complete a quiz in order to test the knowledge that they gained from the information pages.
